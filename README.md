# Inventory-Management-System


### The main problem:

If you’re still using a  paper sheets to manage inventory, you’re behind the times! paper sheets solve a lot of problems, but keeping track of large inventory on a paper is dangerous and inefficient. A paper sheets can be accidentally deleted and it is very difficult for more than one person to work on it, especially simultaneously. Software specifically built to keep track of your inventory solves both of these problems and many more.

### Idea :
Create website that have a benefit to manage inventory in easy way by software rather than manage it by traditional way using paper. And make the process of tracking goods easier.
